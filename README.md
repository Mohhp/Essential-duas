### 🛠️ Known Issues / Recent Fixes

- **PWA manifest paths** — Fixed start_url / scope to relative `./` for GitHub Pages deployment (v22 cache bump).
- **Pashto parser bug** — Stray multiline string fragment in `pashto.js` caused a JS parse error; corrected.
- **Pashto translations** — Comprehensive review pass: corrected spelling (بی→بې, چی→چې), honorifics (ﷺ, رضي الله عنه), and natural grammar across all 63 duas.
- **Search empty-section hiding** — `filterDuas()` now hides section headers when no matching cards exist.
